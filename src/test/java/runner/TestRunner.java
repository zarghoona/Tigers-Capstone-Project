//	Cucumber Options: 
//		We will use JUnit to setup the TestRunner class and to run our tests 
//		we will use the @RunWith(Cucumber.class)
//		Cucumber Option, by using these option we can glue our features with stepDefinition methods and by using 
//		other option, we can add the feature,scenario, or scenario outline tag and run those specific test 
//		@CucumberOptions(we can use all cucumber options we need here)

//	The options in cucumber are: 
//		features = we can add the path to our feature files here 
//		glue = we can add the path to our stepDefinitions and those stepDefinitions will be glued to our features 
//		tag = By adding the tags we will specify which feature, scenario, scenario outline we want to run 
//		dryRun = If we set this to true, it will check and make sure we have stepDefinition methods for each of the 
//		test step in our feature files, but if we set this to false, then it will run all of the tests that we have added 
//		the tag in feature file and to tag option in TestRunner class 
//      the strict tag will mark our scenario as failed if there is not stepDefination method available
//		monochrome = will help us to print the stepDefinition methods in clean format in the console and we have to set this to true
